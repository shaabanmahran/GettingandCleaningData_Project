GettingandCleaningData_Project
==============================
Course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" clourse; part of data science series of courses

All code is in one file: "run_analysis.R"
Output of steps 1-4 is in my_data
Final Output of step 5 is in my_data2
Both the script file "run_analysis.R" and "UCI HAR Dataset" data subfolder should be in the current working directory

Target is to : 
* Read provided data 
* merge (append) test data with training data set
* Select only some columns of the data (mean, std)
* Add columns for subject and activity available in separate files to the data set
* Add description of activity, not only the id
* summarize this data into a new dataset containing means for all combinations of activity, subject

Approach:
* *rbind* was used for merging training and test data
* *grep* was used to find columns of mean or std. Criterion is column name contains the string 'mean()' or 'std()'. 
  * Note: I exploit the fact that 'std' and 'mean' never appeared together; otherwise this should have been handled differently to avoid duplication of features.
* The resulting vector of features is used to subset the dataset
* New columns are added to the data set: activity_id, subject
* Data is merged (joined) with the activity_labels file to get the description of the activities
* Finally the data is summarized using *melt*ing and *dcast*ing to give the required means
